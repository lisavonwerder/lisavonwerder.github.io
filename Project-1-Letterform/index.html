            <h2>Cooper Black Standard</h2>
            <p>Designed by Oswald Cooper in 1922, Cooper Black is simultaneously bold, soft, and funky, ready to grab your attention and hold it for as long as possible. The ampersand is no exceptionâ€”it swirls across the page (or screen) in a shape not often seen in modern typefaces. In fact, the shape is that of a typically italic ampersand, which is unusual for an Old Style Serif. But like Cooper Black always does, it just works. The subtle flattening at the bottom stabilizes the letterform, while the tiny counterforms keep it tight and intriguing. </p>
