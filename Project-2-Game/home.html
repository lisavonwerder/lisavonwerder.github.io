Maybe she shouldn’t have put it off, but she did, and now she’s stressed out of her <i>mind</i> trying to make headway in this essay. She has an introductory paragraph and half a body paragraph, but her eyes are getting bleary and she has a feeling her words are starting to jumble together into nonsense. 
            </p>
            <p>She needs to take a break to relieve all that stress so she can work productively, and that’s where you can help. After all, huge amounts of stress are detrimental to physical health, mental health, and quality of work. Press START to begin!</p>
